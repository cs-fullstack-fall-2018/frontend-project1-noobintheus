    <h1>Devyn Allen</h1>
    <p>Hello! Im sure you can see those giant letters above this text that spell out my name (Devyn Allen). Obviously, this is my portfolio for any and all potential employers but specifically employers looking for a software programmer on a beginner level. Ive went through a 6 month program called "Code school" based in Memphis,TN. Im going to list off a few of my characteristics that I will go into a deeper explanation
        for those of you that want to fall asleep. I have a few interesting qualities though, for example, im a very determined person. I graduated High school a year early. As I type this I am 17 years old though as you read this I will surely be 18. Im a natural leader and will speak my mind when necessary but I can also follow and support if needed and properly guided. Lastly, I can learn whatever you want me to. As long as the time is spent on me, ill grow to the top in no time flat. I hate overselling myself so we'll move on.    </p>

    <h3>Work Experience and reasons for leaving</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Right so, Ive only been old enough to work for 2 years now and with early grad and a few problems along the way, I havent had many jobs but they were decent jobs that gave me alot and I appreciate them for that.
            Here's the list:
        <li>Target was my very first job, I was hired for seasonal work and we were almost never busy. The pay was great but standing in front of a empty register all night was depressing and I definitely couldnt handle that at the time.  </li>
        <li>Funny enough I think my second job was Code Crew. I was having trouble finding a job after Target and I went to this big men of color meet up where there were employers from everywhere. I was in the middle of filling out a Dennys application and two women come and sit infront of me. Dressed modestly and nice. To this day, I have no idea why they picked me out of everyone in there but thank God. I met Dianne Terrel the executive director of the Memphis Grizz and Heather Jamerson another extremely important woman. I told them my story and instantly I met Meka. </li>
        <li>My third job was little ceasers and I worked that and Code crew side by side.</li>
        <li>For personal reasons I had troubles and lost both jobs. When I came back, Code crew took me back into their arms.</li>
        <li>Then I got a second job working replenishment team at michal's from 3am to 10am and still worked for code crew </li>
        <li>Then I started doing Code school</li>
    </ul>

    </p>*Keep in mind I dont know the specific dates and times. They were few and far between but all within 2 years.
